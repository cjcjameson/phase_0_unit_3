### Reflection

A few loops thrown in there, but pretty easy to pick up. I was excited to research double selects on my own to figure them out.
I did this a lot a my old job, but within Microsoft Access so all the code was abstracted away from me. I still have the
relevant intuition about how things need to work and what a GROUP BY is used for (so common in the real world! Big Data needs to be rolled up)
